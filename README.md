# 📊 Robo-Advisor Portfolio Analyzer

An interactive investment advisory tool built in Python that simulates personalized portfolios based on user preferences and risk profiles. The application combines financial analytics, portfolio optimization, and an intuitive Gradio interface to deliver insights on asset allocation, ESG integration, and investment performance.

## 🚀 Features

- **User Questionnaire**: Collects personal and financial details including investment goals, income, net worth, and ESG preference.       This part is aimed at simulating a registration phase. It does not effect other stages in the process and does not save the information.

- **Risk Profiling**: Uses behavioral questions to assess user risk appetite and classify into Conservative, Moderate, or Aggressive profiles.       This questionnaire allows the user to understand what type of an investor they are from three categories:      - Conservative (a profile that would prefer safety over gains, the future result of the recommended portfolio would be a low volatilty combination of allocated assets and lower returns).      - Moderate (a portfolio that is more balaced, allocating more investments towards riskier assets that promise higher yields).      - Aggressive ( a profile that would allocate more investments towards riskier assets, but that have to potential to yield higher returns).

- **Portfolio Analyzer**: This part simulates an easy product for advisors, based on the risk level of the profile (and predefined weights for each asset based on the profile and ESG preference) the customer will recieve metrics of volatilty and sharpe ratio that can help them see what are the expected returns for their investment based on historical data.      

  - Simulates portfolio growth over time based on historical data.    
  - Calculates key performance metrics: annualized return, volatility, Sharpe ratio.    
  - Generates asset-level insights and correlation heatmaps.
  - The suggested portfolio considers all aspects above to generate a portfolio based on the pre-defined weights that a risk profile has.

Asset Level Metrics:    An allocation distribution table that the customer can see how much they invest and in which type of asset.

- **Efficient Frontier Optimization**:    A more advanced tool that can create an advised portfolio - based on the assets given to it - to simualte many combinations of weights given to assets (in this case 5000 simulations) that create an efficient frontier graph on a space of Volatilty vs. Expected returns. It is a powerful tool for an investor to plan their allocation of investemnts to which type of an asset. The advantage of this tool is that it creates an "efficient frontier" which is the invisible curve created by every dot. That curve is where the most efficient combination of assets are created in a portfolio and an investor is advised to choose from this line where there is the trade-off between volatilty and expected returns. 
  - Visualizes optimal portfolios based on risk-return trade-offs.    
  - Implements constraints for diversification (min 5% per asset, max 5 assets). I created this restriction as sometimes it would allocate more than 90% to one type of an asset and 0.01% to another.      
  - Compares Sharpe-optimal and minimum-volatility portfolios for ESG and non-ESG universes.
